# Machine-Learning-Project
Project Topic -- Prediction of Wine Quality on the basis of some physiochemical parameters. 
In this project, we will discuss the dataset, preprocess it, analyse it, run algorithms on it and then evaluate the performance of the algorithms(advantages, pitfalls,etc).
Following points are to be noted about the project:
  1. The "FinalCodeForEachAlgorithm" folder consists of the individual python code for each algorithm.
  2. The Data preprocessing is done in DataPreprocessing.ipynb file
  3. Comparison and evaluation of algorithms is done in Evaluation.ipynb file.
  4. All the algorithms are combined in the MLAlgorithms.ipynb file.
  5. The 'Datasets' folder consists of the original kaggle dataset, the preprocessed wine quality dataset and the performance metrics of the ML Algorithms which we ran.
